```
const jwt = generateJWT(user)
```

**jsonwebtoken** (jwt) is a library to help with the heavy lifting

```
// Generate JWT
jwt.sign(user, config.jwt.secret);

// Send back JWT as a token in addition to the info (user) that was being requested
res.status(200).send({ auth: true, token: jwt, user: user.short()});
```
